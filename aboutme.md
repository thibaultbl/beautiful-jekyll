My name is Thibault Blanc. I currently work as a data scientist @Orange, leading telecom company in France.

I come from a heavy statistic & machine learning background with a strong coding specialization.

Today, I am trying to improve my software engineering skills and I am more and more interested by data vizualisation.

I will use this blog to share and keep track of my progress.
